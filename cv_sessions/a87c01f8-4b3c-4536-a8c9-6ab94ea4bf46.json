His project experience in image restoration and rain removal using LSTM, ResNet, and other relevant tools demonstrates a strong technical foundation. While he possesses strong technical skills, he may need to highlight experiences related to requirement gathering, documentation (BRD, FRD), wireframing, UAT, and Agile/Scrum practices to directly align with the job description, and further emphasize his communication skills and familiarity with tools like Jira, Trello, Notion, and Confluence. His intermediate English proficiency and proactive learning attitude align with the cultural fit and communication requirements of the role.",
