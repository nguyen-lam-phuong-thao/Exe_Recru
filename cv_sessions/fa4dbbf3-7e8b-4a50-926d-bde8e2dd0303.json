His project experience with Python, LSTM, ResNet, and other relevant technologies demonstrates a proactive approach to technology, while his familiarity with developer tools like Git and VS Code, along with data visualization skills using Power BI, could be beneficial. His intermediate English proficiency and objective to improve communication skills align with the job's need for good communication. A potential gap is experience with specific tools like Jira, Trello, Notion, and Confluence, as well as a deeper understanding of software systems (APIs, databases, UI/UX), though his existing knowledge provides a solid foundation for learning.",
    "alignment_with_jd": "1. **Key Matches**:\n    *   **GPA:** The CV mentions a GPA of 3.42, meeting the minimum requirement of 3.0/4.0.\n    *   **English:** The CV states \"English (Intermediate)\", which could potentially align with the B2 requirement if the candidate can demonstrate the required proficiency level (IELTS 6.0, TOEIC 800, Cambridge C1).\n    *   **Skills:** The candidate demonstrates a passion for technology.\n    *   **Technical skills**: The candidate has experience with programming languages such as Python, SQL, and Javascript.\n    *   **Project Experience**: The candidate has experience in software development projects.\n\n2.  **Missing Elements**:\n    *   **Experience**: The job description requires less than 2 years of full-time work experience. The CV does not explicitly state whether the candidate meets this requirement.\n    *   **Documentation Skills**: The JD emphasizes creating BRDs, FRDs, and user stories. The CV doesn't mention experience in these areas.\n    *   **Wireframing/Mockups**: The JD mentions creating wireframes or mockups (Figma or similar). This is missing from the CV.\n    *   **Agile/Scrum**: While the candidate mentions project experience, there's no explicit mention of Agile/Scrum experience.\n    *   **Google Workspace**: The CV does not mention familiarity with Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides).\n    *   **Jira, Trello, Notion, Confluence**: The CV does not show exposure to tools like Jira, Trello, Notion, Confluence.\n    *   **Software Systems Understanding**: The CV does not explicitly demonstrate a basic understanding of how software systems work (APIs, databases, UI/UX).\n\n3.  **Overall Match Score**: 50/100\n\n4.  **Suggestions for Improvement**:\n    *   **Quantify English Proficiency**: Specify English proficiency level more clearly (e.g., IELTS score if available).\n    *   **Highlight Relevant Coursework**: Mention any coursework related to business analysis, requirements gathering, or software engineering principles.\n    *   **Add Documentation Experience**: If the candidate has created any documentation (even in academic projects), include it.\n    *   **Include Tools**: If the candidate has used tools like Figma, Jira, Trello, Notion, or Confluence, even in a limited capacity, add them to the skills section.\n    *   **Address Work Experience**: Explicitly state that the candidate has less than 2 years of full-time work experience (if true).\n    *   **Tailor Objective**: Rephrase the objective to focus on the specific skills and interests relevant to the ITBA Trainee role (e.g., interest in business analysis, requirements gathering, and software development lifecycle).\n    *   **Add soft skills**: Add soft skills to the resume, such as communication and teamwork.",
